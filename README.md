# What people do we want to respect us?
Sometimes It's not *quite* obvious why people are trying to show yourself to someone more **"cooler"** then to others. Let's make it a little bit more explicit. 
##### I create some structure to this topic to make it more ordered and clear. Each subtopic is equal to a question:
* **Is** this relevant to all people?
* **Why** do we need to be respected?
* **When** do we pay attention to others people's thoughts of us and when we don't?
* **What** people are they?

You don't really need to read each point fully, you can get the idea from the first word of every item. So, the thoughts I'll point out are mine, and can be criticized. I'd like to hear your feedback. It'll help to make this theory more perfect.

## **Is?**
> The fact, that we all is called "people", is already making us very similar, isn't it?

The major similarity is our **origin**. I'm not talking about some microorganisms. The first people were living about `200,000` years ago. Then our genetic code evolved, but this process was very slow, it couldn't make such a *quick jump* (only during the last `50,000` years, we learned from using a hammer to flying in the space). So, **what happened?**

Most scientists think culture caused it. When we are born, we are almost the same as we were at `50,000` years ago, but then our parents and/or other people teach us some things. As more we learn as more complicated things we can do. The person, that was born about `50,000` years ago, had no need to hope that somehow he learned how to make a hammer out of stone, he can be taught by another person. This saved time to move forward and explore new things.

> So, even now, when there are more than 7bn people, I assume, we are monkey in the roots of our mind and behavior.


## **When?**
