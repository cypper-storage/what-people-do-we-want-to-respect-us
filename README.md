# What people do we want to respect us?
Sometimes It's not *quite* obvious why people are trying to show yourself to someone more **"cooler"** then to others. Let's make it a little bit more explicit. 
##### I create some structure to this topic to make it more ordered and clear. Each subtopic is equal to a question:
* **Is** this relevant to all people?
* **Why** do we need to be respected?
* **When** do we pay attention to others people's thoughts of us and when we don't?
* **What** people are they?

You don't really need to read each point fully, you can get the idea from the first word of every item. So, the thoughts I'll point out are mine, and can be criticized. I'd like to hear your feedback. It'll help to make this theory more perfect.

## **Is?**
> *The fact, that we all is called "people", is already making us very similar, isn't it?*

The major similarity is our **origin**. I'm not talking about some microorganisms. The first people were living about `200,000` years ago. Then our genetic code evolved, but this process was very slow, it couldn't make such a *quick jump* (only during the last `50,000` years, we learned from using a hammer to flying in the space). So, **what happened?**

Most scientists think culture caused it. We are born almost the same as we were at `50,000` years ago, but then our parents and/or other people teach us some things. As more we learn as more complicated things we can do. The person, that was born about `50,000` years ago, had no need to hope that somehow he learned how to make a hammer out of stone, he can be taught by another person. This saved time to move forward and explore new things.

## **Why?**

It's the simple question.
> *As better we are, as better people surround us.*

It can be true only in our days *(of course, if you think about mental component)*. Years ago people didn't care how clever their partner is. They could choose someone by their body shapes or how they smell or what they do or something like that.
    So, you assume that if you have respect you are better? Yes, if somebody treats you arrogantly or enviously or *respectfully*, that **points out** they respect you, at least they think you are *better*.
    
## **When?**

> *It would be easy to say all time, every second. Is it TRUE?*

The majority of people don't care how they look, eat, breathe when they are around persons, that they used to know for a long time and also when they are around complete strangers (not working for all people, because I think, they have a hidden hope that the stranger will bring, give, become something good for them).
> *It seems we eliminate every possible thought. Then when do we care?*

Easy, when we are surrounded by `'these'` people. What `'these'` people are I'll tell you in about a few seconds.

## **What?**
